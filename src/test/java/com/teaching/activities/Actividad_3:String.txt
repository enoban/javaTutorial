String operations:

The objective of this activity is to learn how to use the strings already implemented in strings to create self built functions.
Reference can be found in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html

Note:
* All functions may receive parameters to evaluate their content.

1. Create a method named "countChars" that counts the number of times a given character is contained in a given string.
   For example, if "This is a sentence" is provided and the character to find is "e", then this function may return a 3.
   If the character to find is "o", then this function may return 0.

2. Create a method named "insertAt" that inserts a character in a given position of the string.
   Take in account the first position of the String is always 0.
   For example, if "This is a sentence" is provided, the character to insert is "x" and the position is 3, then this function
   may return "Thixs is a sentence".

3. Create a method named "replaceLast" that replaces the last ocurrence of a char sequence in a string for another string.
   For example, if "This is a plant, this is an egg, this is a fruit" is provided, the sequence to be found is "this" and the replacement is "another"
   then this function may return "This is a plant, this is an egg, another is a fruit".

4. Create a method named "timesContained" that counts the number of times a char sequence is contained in a string.
   For example, if "This is a plant, this is an egg, this is a fruit" is provided and the sequence to be found is "this", then this
   function may return 3.

5. Cesarian encryption: This consists by replacing the characters contained in a string by the characters located in another position, given a
   fixed pattern. For example, letters can be shifted exactly three positions, which means the following
   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
   D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C

   Any "a" will become a "d", any "b" will become an "e" and so on.
   Implement a method that makes a caesarian encryption to a given string, from the given pattern provided above.
   If "Hello world" is provided, then "Khoor aruog" is the expected output.

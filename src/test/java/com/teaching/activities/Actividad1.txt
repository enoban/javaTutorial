Activity 1: Design the UML diagram and the respective class according to the following description.

Hello. My name is Odin. I am the main god from norse mythology. I have power over many things, such
as healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy and the runic
alphabet. I am married to Figg.

I am also known by different names in different languages, such as Wóden in Old English, Wöden in old
Saxon and Wuotan in Old High German language.

I also have many sons. Some of them are Thor, Baldr, Bidarr, and Váli. Other people relate more gods
as my sons, such as Heimdallr, Gragi, Tyr, and Hod. And oh, I live in Vallhala.

I can, with the aid of my powers, turn people into harmless sheep. I call this power "sheep for a day".
I can also give life to inanimate things, such as rocks. I call this power "live and walk".
I can... well... control weather. I can make heavens rain, droughts last for a long time, generate
hazes, start tornadoes and create hurricantes. I call them "rainy rainy", "hot as hell", "marble rain",
"spin me round round" and "wind and rain" respectively.

I only have to say a phrase for each of my powers to make them become real.

And oh... if anyone needs to know information about me, they must ask me for it, not just read my mind.
And also, if anyone needs to modify the information about my wife, my sons, my powers or my alternative
names, they should also ask me for it.
